# AlpineTime

The project estimation tool from tomorrow. It's so tomorrow that it displays a blank screen now.

### Investigate

Vis.js for the charts

TimeSheet.js also looks cool

Does react-router remotely help me?

Use nunjucks for the server-side templating

Flux implementation?

 - implement it on your own and be miserable?
 
### Backend

Do I need to make something "isomorphic"? Not sure. I want to use Nim-lang on the back-end.
