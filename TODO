Client side:
  ✔ Create generic list .\client\js\components\main\GenericList.jsx @started(15-03-17 09:42) @high @done (15-03-17 22:57) @lasted(13:15)
  ☐ Load all the visible stuff and dump it on pouch.db
    ☐ include pouch.db in the solution
    ☐ attach to document onload, load all the entities required, show loading bar
    ☐ when finished, render react-router
  ☐ Show
    ☐ packages under projects
    Do they need their own page too? I suppose not.
    ☐ Show tasks under packages
    ☐ Sub-task support? Maybe blockedBy?
  ☐ Show categories and statuses from lookups
  ☐ Show projects under customers
  ☐ Create a test.html

Server-side:
  ☐ Write tests @high
  ☐ Create an API for
    ☐ CurrentUser
    ☐ Package
    ☐ Task
    ☐ Estimation
  ☐ Change Category, ProjectCategory, ConceptStatus and TechnicalStatus with Lookup
  ☐ Add VisibleTo
  ☐ Add CanBeEditedBy
  ☐ Restrict Access based on VisibleTo and CanBeEditedBy
    This may be a bad idea. I still need to think about the permission system
  ☐ Create form submission handling to models.
    I can use the forms helper of the gin framework with my existing models

Research:
 ☐ How to handle forms
   ☐ I need to create some sort of validation from the models. "go run generateValidationsModels.go"?
   ☐ I could also parse golang with javascript and then things would get fancy. @badidea
